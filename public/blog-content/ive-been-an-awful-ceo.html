<p>As the very reluctant CEO of Taught by Humans, rarely do I have a week where I think “god I really knocked it out of the park as CEO this week”. Usually because, let's be honest, I'd rather be coding or creating content (the rest kind of feels like playing business to me).</p>

<p>This week I feel I've actively made choices that make me a bad CEO - mainly missing some networking / selling opportunities.</p>

<h3>Still Figuring Out the Hiring Bit</h3>

<p>We're delightfully growing as a team. Our two current employees are doing amazing jobs, two more interns from local uni schemes are joining by July, some students from UoB are helping on a project in a few weeks, we’ve got feelers out for some freelancers, and we are about to pop up some part-time job ads.</p>

<p>I'm officially in the intern army stage of start-up growth. And I'm loving it - when I mention hiring, it's usually met with a mix of excitement and people telling me how much they hate people management, but I deeply enjoy it (probably links back to the reasons I'm so obsessed with learning).</p>

<h3>Should I Have Gone to That Event? Probably</h3>

<p>This week I was scheduled to attend two full-day events - both good for the company brand, and potential opportunities for some new customers. So as CEO (and currently our only salesperson) I probably should have attended.</p>

<p>The option to go meant the team would just crack on with some business-as-usual tasks (marketing, making content, writing assessment questions, other useful things) - but if I was working, there were opportunities to give more impactful work. Work that, if I went to the events, I'd probably have picked up on the weekend or in the evenings. Work I could easily do myself - but that would give others a chance to learn a new skill, go deeper into the business, and bring new thinking to the project.</p>

<h3>Maybe This Is Good CEO-ing</h3>

<p>Last week a chat with Caroline Clark (Operations Advisor for SETsquared Bristol) got me thinking about how the business needs to grow at its own pace, and how I grow with the business. And while I am the CEO, I’m also now the manager of a growing team - who hopefully will stick around for a bit and grow with the business.</p>

<p>So in being a bad CEO, I’ve helped the business (our grant application is definitely better than one I knocked out on the train or at the weekend). I’ve got an employee who has happily spent the day delving into evaluation plans for educational pilots (a great use of her teaching experience). And I got to the gym, had lunch in the sun, and I feel remarkably more on top of things.</p>

<p>Yet again, on this odd journey of being a founder, I find myself having to completely change how I exist. I think the manager hat suits me a lot better than the CEO one, thankfully.</p>
