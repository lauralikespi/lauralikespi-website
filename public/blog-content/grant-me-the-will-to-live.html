<p>Last week I shared on LinkedIn about Taught by Humans winning an InnovateUK grant (my most popular post ever with 300 likes and counting - officially an influencer now…)</p>

<p>I’m extremely excited and proud of this achievement (although a little weary of the admin side of an InnovateUK grant). But I’m keen on being realistic about running a business as it isn’t all glamorous and easy, even if social media does a great job of making it seem that way.</p>

<h3>Too Many Grants</h3>

<p>I’m actually not very successful with grants. My InnovateUK portal is mostly unsuccessful applications.</p>

<img src="/images/blog/grant-failures.png"/>
<p>Last year I applied for a lot of grants, and apart from some small grants from University of Bristol or UWE, most were unsuccessful. This was a mix of our business being a little too small, the projects being a bit forced to fit the brief and me only deciding to apply last minute (just in case). The last one being a lesson in trusting your gut, and not applying unless it’s really well suited and you have the time.</p>

<p>In 2025 so far (it’s May), I have applied for 5 grants (and one Uni related one but it feels different). The applications have felt like a plague on my life - I love the project planning bit but hate fitting a project to the odd rules and timescales that come with grants. And actually writing the application questions always makes me want to quit running a business (or just give up and get back to actually running the business).</p>

<h3>Here’s a little run through of what I’ve submitted this year:</h3>

<h4>Design Foundations</h4>
<p>Through InnovateUK. Usually opens every 6 months (Jan and Sep deadlines). It’s fully funded up to £80k, and it has any project using human-centred design.</p>

<p>I submitted a joint application with Inclusive Change to look at workplace learning for neurodiverse employees at startups. We actually scored highly on this, and got no negative feedback but the grant had over 500 applications to award 8 grants so competition was tough. Rather than being completely gutted, I’ve taken this as a little win and hopefully we can improve for next time or get another grant for the project. I did also submit this grant with a 40 degree fever (all the work was done, just needed uploaded but a big realisation that I needed to hire people so I can actually rest when I’m sick), so I was also relieved I’d copy and pasted everything in the right place.</p>

<h4>UFI Voctech Activate</h4>
<p>Opens every January, £60k no match funding. For vocational education technology which is for underserved learners.</p>

<p>I’m on application number 4 for this one. It feels a little like magic as to what they are looking for. InnovateUK gets a lot of comments on the feedback they give - for this grant you get one sentence for round one, and two sentences for round two. Not exactly something you can take and use next year. I submitted a big new project for this (creating pathways into AI jobs for unemployed people), and for the first time got through to the second round. Although I am a bit suspicious that I sent a lot of emails about help for being dyslexic and maybe that’s the reason I was finally successful… The first round has lots of 100 word questions (which I find so hard to write). Round 2 is responses to questions markers had on round 1, a detailed project plan, and a product description with one 2 minute video link. So a lot of work to not get detailed feedback on. The project was rejected after the second round (and honestly I found the two sentences quite confusing, I would have said the opposite about our application), but we’ll try again next year. And we’re going to try and get some different money for the project.</p>

<h4>Smart Data Challenge Prize</h4>
<p>A bit of a random grant for access to some Government dummy data and £50k to build a project.</p>

<p>I did write the entire thing in 1.5 hours with a blinding migraine. Rejected with no feedback at all.</p>

<h4>Runway Awards</h4>
<p>This is the University of Bristol one for students and recent grads.</p>

<p>The process includes a 10 minute recorded pitch, and then a live pitch. Much more suited to me. Much friendlier audience. We were awarded £15k this year and last year.</p>

<h4>NCFE Innovation in Assessments</h4>
<p>Up to £125k for an assessment related project. Only 2 awards were given (but only 65 applications were submitted so quite good odds).</p>

<p>Round 1 is a submission of interest, 3 questions. I really liked this format as it wasn’t too much work up front. We were one of the 18 projects through to round two which had more detailed questions, a project plan and a risk register. We’re waiting to hear back (and round 3 will be 6 projects being interviewed).</p>

<h4>BridgeAI AI Solutions for AI Competencies in Key Sectors</h4>
<p>Another InnovateUK one with matched funding 30% on projects up to £100k.</p>

<p>This is the one we were awarded.</p>

<h3>What Have I Learnt?</h3>

<p>Our biggest value at Taught by Humans is Always Learning so as usual I like to find the lesson in everything.</p>

<p>But here are the important things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Grants are not a given.</strong> A lot of founders and business owners seem to think grants are easy to get and almost like a given right to any business. They are actually really competitive, and usually really specific. We are lucky that future of work skills, and AI for education is quite in at the minute, but this could go away at any time (and a lot of the AI grants are for industries other than ours so we are automatically out).</li>
  <li><strong>The applications are long and time consuming.</strong> So being choosy is important. We’ve found we’ve done a lot better with projects super related to what we already do or plan to do, rather than fitting a project to the grant.</li>
  <li><strong>AI is a great help.</strong> I’m quite dyslexic and have found using ChatGPT well to help structure my thoughts or make the responses easier to read has been invaluable. I do not get AI to project plans or come up with the entire response, it’s just small tweaks to make it clearer and more consistent.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The One We Actually Won - BridgeAI</h3>

<p>The BridgeAI grant we have been awarded is so relevant to what we already do, but it was in one of 4 industries (which was our project for the grant to pivot the tech and content for a new industry). We luckily have a few construction people in our network so reached out to them to have a chat, and formed a really interesting project. I spent ages on the plan, and the questions. We were also lucky to get some feedback from a grant reviewer via InnovateUK Business Growth.</p>

<p>I am very much looking forward to the project (and so thankful to have been awarded the grant), but I am also really looking forward to a break in grant applications (until September when the next batch comes around usually).</p>
