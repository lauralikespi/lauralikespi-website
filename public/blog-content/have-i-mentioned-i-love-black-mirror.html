Season 6 of my favourite (yes I’m going that far) TV show has been announced and teased by Netflix. If you’re as into this show as me, you’ll know it has been a LONG time coming. The most recent season, season 5, was released on Netflix in 2019 (so pre-pandemic, that is a lifetime ago). Needless to say - I’m excited. 











Since finishing the torturous years of writing my thesis, I’ve found I love writing (particularly when I get to give an opinion), so I’m scratching the itch by dissecting this disturbing dystopian daydream - and any excuse to rewatch all 5 seasons. As if I need an excuse to watch Black Mirror, one of my long standing December traditions is to do so (ba-humbug indeed). I recently fell in love with Miley Cyrus’s song Flowers, and what did I do, rewatched all of Black Mirror (because she is in one of the episodes in the fifth season) obviously.




A Small History of Black Mirror [No Spoilers]

The Very First Episode

Those who aren’t from the UK might not remember the very first episode airing. Way back in 2011, when I was a university student in Northern Ireland, an advert for this new show was played on the UK’s edgiest TV channel:













A twisted trio. What a bloody amazing TV advert. Maybe I’d lived a sheltered life so far, but I was already hooked. I convinced my flatmates to watch along live with me. I’m not sure what anyone was expecting, I think I was expecting new technology (what was this brain implant mentioned in the advert?), maybe robots or holograms. 



Then it started. A very non-techy typical British political drama. It literally could have been set in 2011. I won’t go into detail, in case you haven’t yet seen the very first episode. But it aimed to shock and it definitely succeeded. My flatmates chatted over it, finding it funny and gross. They declared it an absolute let down.



I, on the other hand, was hooked. I rewatched on catch up by myself during the week, which resulted in my flatmates remarking I was “an absolute weirdo”. So my secretive love of Black Mirror was born, and I watched all the Channel 4 episodes by myself, and told no one.





Channel 4 Era - Dark and British

There were three more episodes in this first series - one a not so subtle comment on the nation’s obsession with talent based reality TV shows, the other a deeply disturbing first look at the grain technology mentioned in the advert.



2 years later we were blessed with a second season and three more episodes. The first haunts me to this day, in its attempt to show how technology can be used to “bring us back” after we die. The other two, while amazing, were definitely growers for me - one extremely dark (despite its name White Bear) and the other a funny (but scarily real - isn’t that Black Mirror’s charm sometimes) look at personas rather than people as politicians. Both these episodes become more and more relevant every day.



Then the following year, the final Channel 4 episode was a multiple story Christmas special - one of my favourite ever episodes. Ending my secret love affair with this strange TV show, for now.











Streamification - Netflix’s Grubby American Hands

Then the world kind of changed - both in terms of TV watching habits which went from people live watching shows on a particular channel once a week, to unlimited access to streaming services and episodes on demand; and for me, who was no longer a student or working a data job, I had joined the dream team of Technology Innovation (it was literally my job to think about cool tech all day). This new job came with some new colleagues, who were amazingly excited when a new series of Black Mirror was announced. Yay, I’d finally found my people. They even wanted to chat and dissect every episode. 



This third series came - bigger, shinier, more American than the previous two. But like I’ve mentioned, the world had changed and this series was just what was needed. It was 5 episodes instead of three, and they are all glorious. They are diverse, and oh my god, did they make me think - is technology good or evil?



Delightfully this sparked a new release every year for 4 years - 3 series and one interactive movie (of which I was not a fan, I don’t include it in my rewatches, maybe time to try again?) The next two seasons were strange - I watched them as soon as possible but I wasn’t in love with them. In rewatching them, I have changed my mind about most of the episodes. Except the one with the robot dog, which I just do not get at all.











Why I Love This Mindfuck

I’m not alone in loving this show - with 8.8 on IMDB and 87% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

Black Mirror taps into something very core in me - storytelling, imagining futurist technology and the impacts of this tech on people and society. I would go as far as to say, my weird obsession with this show has really shaped a lot of things about me (or maybe it just fanned a fire that was already there).



The show and the stories in the episodes explore some very deep (often disturbing) themes. I find myself thinking about certain episodes often. When I read a news story about what some tech giant is doing, I wonder if they took something different from a particular Black Mirror episode (I saw it as a cautionary tale, they saw it as a great idea). I also love the links between the episodes - the same tech, the same song, subtle mentions.



There are twists, which were particularly well done in the early seasons when episodes always ended with a short dramatic look at every possible storyline (almost like Love Actually). The brilliance of the stories in Black Mirror is that they are never completely predictable, they take you on a journey - usually one that ends in a car crash, there are no happy endings to be found.



On looking at when Black Mirror usually graces our screens, 3 out of 5 seasons and 2 special episodes were all released in December. And as I love to rewatch old seasons before a new season comes out, I finally understand my weird Christmas tradition. One which needs to be moved to May this year, before season 6 comes out.
