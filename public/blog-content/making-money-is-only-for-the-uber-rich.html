<p>Last year I was really excited to get a scholarship (thank you Cornerstone VC) to take the amazing <a href="https://angelinvestingschool.com/" target="_blank">Angel Investing School</a> course about becoming an Angel Investor. It was really valuable, and each week had a host of experts. I also met some really interesting and inspiring people who for various reasons wanted to get into Angel Investing.</p>

<p>One thing that is discussed throughout the course (and actually in any panel discussion or talk on Angel Investing) is small ticket investments - this is where an investor gives a smaller amount of money. Perhaps in the £100s or £1,000s to one or a few companies. Actually I’m hearing quite often from Angels and Founders (the people running a startup) about £5k investments to get things going.</p>

<p>Why I wanted to do this Angel Investing course started because I am advisor to two really wonderful female founder led businesses, and ultimately I wanted to be able to put my money where my mouth was. As a founder myself, I know that advice is literally everywhere - good advice, and cash is what’s needed and it’s a lot harder to come by. Especially for women and global majority founders (I saw UWE using this term and they say “Global Majority is a collective term used to describe individuals from Black, Asian, Indigenous and Racially Minoritised backgrounds. Its use recognises that despite being in the minority in the UK, people from these backgrounds represent approximately 85% of the world’s population.”)</p>

<p>I have taken a step back from thinking about Angel Investing while I focus on getting Taught by Humans where I want it - but it is something I plan to do in the future and these new regulations around High Net Worth Individuals are really upsetting me.</p>

<p><strong>Is £100k a lot of money? £170k definitely is.</strong></p>

<p>"Is 'a lot' a big number?""Depends on the context. Dollars? No. Deaths? Yes."- Dr Who</p>

<p>Of course, I think £100k is a lot of money. This used to be the amount needed to be a High Net Worth individual and become a certified Angel Investor (and access some very nice tax relief along with it).</p>

<p>“In the UK, individuals earning over £100k annually are in the top 4% of earners, representing a significant income compared to the majority of the population. By making £104,000 or more, one enters the top 3% of earners in the country.” [<a href="https://moneysprout.co.uk/percentage-of-uk-that-earns-over-100k/" target="_blank">Money sprout</a>]</p>

<p>Considering going from £100k to £104k drops 1 percent of the UK population (roughly 670,000 individuals), think what changing this rule from £100k to £170k does.</p>

<p>To illustrate this point, I have an extremely fortunate group of friends (the vast majority of them work in tech, finance or are doctors, not all but a lot), we’re in our thirties so comfortably into our careers and we chat about money a lot. I know some of them earn above £100k. Literally none of them earn over £170k.</p>

<p>To take this further - one is about to become a consultant psychiatrist, others are high up at Big 4 companies, others are on management teams of scale ups. My point is all really good, high paying jobs. Probably with a bit of spare cash, that they could comfortably use Angel Investing. But they no longer earn enough.</p>

<p><strong>Joke - What’s the Difference Between Angel Investing and Gambling?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve got multiple punchlines to this joke, the more blog appropriate ones go like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Angel Investing isn’t a “tax on the stupid”</li>
  <li>Angel Investing doesn’t make the Government lots of money in taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>I asked ChatGPT to write me a punchline (of course…) and I quite like its response (especially how it explains its own joke):</p>

<p>"The difference? If you earn less than £170k, society prefers you to gamble your savings away rather than invest them wisely."This punchline highlights the irony in how regulations permit high-risk gambling for everyone but restrict potentially lucrative investment opportunities to high earners.</p>

<p>I have a few points here, the first being horribly facetious - everyone is allowed to gamble, everyone is allowed to waste money on horses, football, election results, whatever. People can literally gamble thousands of pounds a year, but we (yes we, I very much don’t qualify to be a High Net Worth Individual) aren’t allowed to invest that money in (ultimately as risky an investment) but with some tax savings and recovery (through SEIS and EIS where if companies go bust investors get some of their money back). That feels a bit like keeping “the poor” down. Similarly, there aren’t regulations around investing in Crypto which has both made and lost a lot of people a lot of money, and is just (if not more) risky than Angel Investing.</p>

<p>Second, this really feels like a step backwards. In the UK, women earn less than their male counterparts. This is represented in high earners - significantly more men than women. In Scotland (the only place I can find real figures for), this brings the number of potential women Angel Investors from 14,000 to 3,500 [Insider]. We know women are more likely to invest in women-led business and understand business in typically women’s issues industries (periods, pregnancy, women’s health, etc). The rule also states that it is £170k in the last year, so that negatively impacts anyone on maternity leave, caring leave, illness or a period of unemployment. No guesses who a majority of caring responsibilities fall on in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Dumb Money</strong></p>

<p>I recently watched the movie <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_Money" target="_blank">Dumb Money</a></em> (it’s a great watch, definitely check it out) about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze" target="_blank">the GameStop scandal</a> a few years ago. Apparently Dumb Money is what Wall Street Big Boys call casual investors (especially those who invest small amounts). But with GameStop, one guy (called Roaring Kitty) and a subreddit following managed to completely change the stock market.</p>

<p>This isn’t a call to action (yet) but rules like this new arbitrary High Net Worth Individual threshold do make me think about how money is allowed to work for the rich but not for everyone else. If the GameStop stock price showed us anything, it’s the power everyone else has if we unite and try to make change. I for one want to take my Dumb Money and make the world a better place.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ll leave you with <a href="https://businessleader.co.uk/content/article/218/Backing-women-led-businesses-is-the-best-idea-you-can-have" target="_blank">an article</a> from the wonderful (Bristol-based) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zara-nanu/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank">Zara Nanu</a> about why we should invest in female business.</p>
