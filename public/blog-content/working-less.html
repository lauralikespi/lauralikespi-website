<p>Last year I posted a LinkedIn post about working too much. It wasn’t meant as a cry for help, but as a glimpse of truth into the usually very shiny version of founder / startup / business owner life. Especially the version shared on social media of wins and talks and the glorious side of hustling. I was also reflecting on how much I hated really “busyyyy” in a desperate way when people asked how things were going.</p>

<p>Now I find myself saying “busy, but in a good way” as that actually is the truth. It's said with a smile and excitement, rather than dead eyes and nervous shaking like last year. Similarly I find myself pondering the working too much part of this again. Interestingly, it’s not coming from stress or overwhelm this time - but from a deeper reflection on what I actually want in life, and whether I can work fewer hours, feel less stress, and be more present.</p>

<h3>How Do You Forget to Go on Holiday?</h3>

<p>So where this all comes from is the realisation that myself and JJ haven't taken a holiday since Sept 2024. It's very unlike us as people who prioritise travelling above most other things, bet on sporting events for who gets to book holidays and have ever growing bucket lists.</p>

<p>This is all highly caveated with the fact that we:</p>
<ul>
  <li>took a week working in Spain in October</li>
  <li>did a spa night in November</li>
  <li>went to Lisbon for JJ’s work in January</li>
  <li>had a weekend in Lyme Regis with the fam</li>
  <li>…and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>But no actual non-weekend or bank days booked off work. The reason isn't one of over work - we planned to go away sometime early 2025, we booked some trips but where we wanted to go were better to travel to in May, June and Sept respectively (Athens, the Dolomites and Canada for those interested). We had plans of booking something before May, we usually work from Spain in March or April. But catching the flu in Jan and both of us having busy event heavy jobs, just meant we never found the right time.</p>

<p>So I find myself in May having not taken a proper break since September. And as always with breaks I realise how important rest and time off is (both for health and creative thinking reasons).</p>

<p>It's got me wondering how I can work to have more of this in my normal routine.</p>

<h3>A Chance to Set a New Tone</h3>

<p>We're at a bit of a transition period at Taught by Humans - from a manic-feeling solo founder baby startup to a busy but sustainable business with multiple employees. It's a chance for me to set a new tone. I could see these new employees as an opportunity for me to take on more and push push push the business. Or I can take a breath, let them settle in then take some things off my plate.</p>

<p>I'm currently opting for some hybrid version - letting them take things, deciding what is ultimately important for me to do, and learning to let go of the rest. With the end goal of me working less hours but getting more of the necessary things for the business to grow done. It's not super easy when you're an impatient workaholic with grand plans and an ever racing mind. But I'm going to try.</p>

<p>And I'm going to document my attempts to find this balance, in a hope that it helps one person find some more peace or contentment in this odd and ever changing journey (and also because writing helps me understand my own thoughts on things).</p>

<p>A massive failure in this in week one - I was only in the office on Wednesday this week (holidays Monday and Tuesday, an event Thursday and a wedding on Friday, so an atypical week). And I did not make it to the gym, and worked until after 10pm.</p>

<p>But I will try again next week, by</p>
<ul>
  <li>Going to the gym 3 times</li>
  <li>Reading a few more chapters of my book</li>
  <li>Rewriting a short story I wrote a 1st messy draft of on a plane</li>
  <li>Practising drawing flowers</li>
  <li>Going climbing or playing lawn bowls with my friends depending on the weather</li>
  <li>Watching at least 2 horror movies</li>
</ul>
