<p>You might be the ripest, juiciest peach in the world, but some people just don’t like peaches - Dita Von Teese</p>

<p>I seem to have accidentally created a brand - and a product - that is a little like Marmite. Last week alone someone told me they hated the branding (the colours are too bright, it’s boring), and three people called out how much they loved my branding (one specifically commenting how it really captures my energy and the company’s ethos). The negative comments have actually started to make me really happy.</p>

<hr/><h3>Feedback Overload</h3>

<p>I have honestly been drowning in feedback in 2024. Some feedback was overwhelmingly positive (to the point of making me tearful), some negative but helpful, and some downright mean and unnecessary (a topic for another day).</p>

<p>It’s been confusing and conflicting - I’ve even had the same pitch deck, at the same event, praised for being slick and well designed; only for the next person to say it was “indelicate and didn’t work at all”.</p>

<p>Originally, I was taking the negative comments to heart. Despite the comments weighing largely on the positive side, I started doubting myself, wondering if I’d gotten tunnel vision because I like the branding and the platform. Forgetting the hours spent getting feedback and testing with actual users.</p>

<p>Eventually (as a data dork) I noticed a telling pattern, and soon I was able to predict if someone was going to have negative, unhelpful comments, or whether they would get the product.</p>

<p>Even still it took someone asking if the comments were coming from people in my target audience, for me to realise I wasn’t building a product for everyone. Everyone doesn’t need to like it. I was building a product for a specific group of people - and those people love it (or so it seems). Isn’t that the whole point of this Product-Market Fit thing everyone talks about?</p>

<h3>I Don’t Care What You Think (As Long As It’s About Me) [Fall Out Boy song…]</h3>

<p>Something that has become very clear - not all opinions are equal. Opinions are important, and it’s good to hear a range of opinions. But unless you are one of my target users or buyers, I genuinely no longer care. We can’t please everyone - even if we were a peach.</p>

<p>We are not building a universally appealing product - because let’s be clear no product is.</p>

<p>Microsoft users typically hate Google products (I’m team Google all the way), and vice versa. Apple vs Android is an ongoing debate - I've been an Android user so long, I can’t even use an iPhone anymore. Even Duolingo’s gamification works for some people, and others find it silly (or the bird to be a bit demotivating). I personally can’t make the very popular HubSpot work for our sales efforts (and I do hate the orange branding), but it has a huge group of advocates. Some people can’t click or navigate properly in Miro, and it infuriates them - I find it intuitive to use.</p>

<h3>Not Everyone’s Cup of Tea</h3>

<p>We can’t afford to be everything to everyone. I’m learning to smile, and feel confident in my decisions as my target customer is responding. This clarity is actually sort of freeing. We can focus on the people who truly get what we’re building. Instead of wasting energy on everyone, we can double down on delivering for the ones who matter most.</p>

<p>We have a target customer. We know our target customer. We are always chatting to them. We are a tiny team. We’ve built a cool thing. It works. It’s pretty slick (if I do say so myself). It’s not perfect. We are doing our best. The product we’ve launched will probably change substantially as our understanding of our product-market fit evolves.</p>

<p>We’re not everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s okay. Actually, that's kind of the point. It’s better to be Marmite, than to end up as nothing to everyone. At the end of the day, not everyone likes peaches - it’s no big deal. We can’t please everyone, we’re for the peach lovers.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing I’m learning - you don’t need everyone to love what you do (as much as you might want them to). Whether you’re building a product, starting a networking group, creating art, or any other endeavour - focus on the people who love what you do, and let the rest go.</p>
